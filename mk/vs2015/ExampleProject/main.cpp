// Visual Studio 2015 Example Project
// ==================================
// This is a solution and project already configured for working with PcapPlusPlus
// All you need is to start writing your code. All include paths, lib paths and linked libs are already set
// This solution and project are also locatable. You can copy/move them to wherever you want
// Before opening this solution, please make sure you run configure-windows-visual-studio.bat. It prepares PcapPlusPlusPropertySheet.props
// which contains paths to PcapPlusPlus location and other 3rd party components (such as WinPcap and pthreads-win32)

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
